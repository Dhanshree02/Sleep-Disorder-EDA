# Sleep-Disorder-EDA

## Overview
This project explores and analyzes a dataset related to sleep disorders. The objective is to clean, visualize, and extract insights from the data to understand patterns and potential factors contributing to sleep disorders.

## Dataset
The dataset includes various attributes such as:
- Age
- Gender
- Sleep Duration
- Sleep Disorder Type
- Stress Levels
- Physical Activity
- Health Conditions

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Plotly

## Installation
Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed before running the notebook.

## Steps in the Project
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies.
2. **Univariate Analysis**: Exploring individual features and their distributions.
3. **Bivariate Analysis**: Understanding relationships between different variables.
4. **Data Visualization**: Using various plots and charts to extract insights.
5. **Key Findings**: Summarizing significant patterns and trends observed in the data.

## Results & Insights
- Identified common sleep disorder trends based on demographic and health factors.
- Visualized correlations between stress levels, physical activity, and sleep quality.
- Highlighted key factors affecting different sleep disorder types.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the notebook step by step to explore the analysis.
